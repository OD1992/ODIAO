Hello! I have done my PhD from UCLouvain (Belgium) on August 28, 2023.
I am interested in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases such as Malaria, particularly in Senegal, and more recently COVID-19. I hold a MSc in Biomathematic and Bioinformatic from Science and Technics faculty of the Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal. 
<br>Outside work, I enjoy soccer and running.
