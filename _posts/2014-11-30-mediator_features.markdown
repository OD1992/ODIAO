Hello! I am currently doing my PhD with <br><a href='https://sites.uclouvain.be/absil/'>Pierre-Antoine Absil</a> (UCLouvain\ICTEAM, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) and Mouhamadou Diallo (Molecular Biology Unit/Bacteriology-Virology Lab, CNHU A. Le Dantec / Université Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar, Sénégal).
I am interested in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases such as Malaria, particularly in Senegal, and more recently COVID-19. I hold a MSc in Biomathematic and Bioinformatic from Sciences and Technics, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal. 
<br>Outside work, I enjoy soccer and running.
